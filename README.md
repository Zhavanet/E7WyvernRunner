# E7WyvernRunner

Project WyvernRunner is a tool using the github.io framework to simulate wyvern runs in E7 and will help determine the succes rate of a Wyvern team using user entered statlines


The end goal for this project is being able to determin the fastest and most stable team in the game as well as suggesting a team using a user's box.

- Currently working on determining how CR and speed works inside of the game 
  - First tests showed that Cr is detemined relative to the fastest hero and 1% cr becomes that hero's speed devided by 100 
  - Testing and modelising cr bar was succesfull and turn order count was also implemented
 
- Project will be migrated to AWS EC2 and will most likely support a DB implemntation
